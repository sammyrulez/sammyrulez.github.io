# I will ride like a gentlemen

On September 24th I will ride in the Distinguished Gentlemen Ride

As a rider of a stylish Ducati Scrambler, I will join my local chapter of the DGR. It is a retro-themed motorbike event, held globally in the world, to raise funds for research into prostate cancer and mental health programs as part of our mission to support men’s health globally. These funds are invested by our partners the Movember Foundation, the world’s largest men’s health organization.

### PROSTATE CANCER

Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. The Movember Foundation is the largest funder of prostate cancer programs in the world.

### SUICIDE PREVENTION | MEN’S MENTAL HEALTH

**3 out of 4 suicides are men**

510,000 men die from suicide globally each year. That’s one every minute. This has to change.

This is my donation page. Every amount is Wellcome and will help someone in need. Thank You.
