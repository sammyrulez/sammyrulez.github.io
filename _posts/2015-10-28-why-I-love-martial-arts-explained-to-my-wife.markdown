# Fighting and martial arts explained to my wife


About a week ago my wife ask me why I put so much effort in my martial art training. It was late, I was tired and did not came up with a good answer. So the day after I wrote an email. This is a translated and redacted version. I hope it could have some good point to explain why you go to the gym, sweat and get your ass kicked on regular basis.
> *Ciao I was intrigued by your questions about why I do kickboxing . In general, where does my passion for martial arts and combat sports originate if you know me as a person devoted to mediation and dialogue. First let’s clear the field from violence. I like the action, but certainly not violence for its own sake . I think I’ve scored a few sentences from the book I’m reading that I believe can be very explanatory : *Physical violence , which is the most obvious, frightening and dramatic manifestation of the conflict is a training tool to overcome the fear of conflict.* Therefore overcome the fear of conflict. As you know I’m always afraid of conflict with you, with colleagues even with our beloved sons. I believe the balance is the way to happiness, an conflict is the opposite of balance. So if you can “balance your conflicts” you are on the road to happiness. I can’t find a better way than martial arts for this process. It is also a way to deal with reality in a different way and this is what really fascinates me. You always say , rightly, that I’m cerebral and analytical kind of person but in combat, there is no time to analyse . Suddenly we find ourselves in a situation where* rational thought has less credit for an invitation to lunch in the village of a cannibal tribe *(cit. Daniele Bolelli ) . It is both exciting and scary to be screened in this dimension.** *[REDACTED]* Martial arts are a mean to get in touch with my potential. In the practice of martial arts there is a return to primordial simplicity . Last but not least are an excellent way to keep fit : I feel like I’m at the same time the artist and the art work. I wanted to explain these things because you’re the person who knows me better and I want to continue to be so. I love you .*
