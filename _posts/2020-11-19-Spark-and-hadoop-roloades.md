The quantity of data is growing exponentially for many reasons these days. Our day-to-day activities in various sources generate lots of data. So, the term ‘big data’ is used to denote a collection of large and complex datasets that is difficult to store and process using the available database management tools or traditional data processing applications.

*Apache Hadoop* was developed to enhance the usage of big data and solve the major issues related to it. Formally, Google invented a new methodology of processing data popularly known as MapReduce. Later, _Doug Cutting_ and _Mike Cafarella_, inspired by the white paper of the MapReduce framework, developed Hadoop to apply MapReduce concepts to an open-source software framework that supported the Nutch search engine project.
